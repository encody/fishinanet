We created a project to help fish farmers how much feed they should be feeding their fish by connecting water temperature. The project consists of an IOT water temperature sensor, and a web app where fish farmers can input in.


The Node server and Angular website are hosted on a Google Cloud Server. The IOT sensor consists of an arduino, bluetooth sensor, and a breakout board.


Future developmenets would be to give better feed recommendations, calculate the feed conversion ratio, and display graphs over time.
